<br>
Start. Sounds and vibrations will warn of the approach and expiration of each phase.
<br>
The data can be exported in csv format, for Numbers or Excel.
<br>
Some examples are pre-loaded.
</p>
<h3>The first page lists the time counter groups.</h3>
<img src="prima_pagina.png" alt="first page" title="first page" />
<p>With the button at the top left you can export all the subjects in a file in csv format, readable by both Numbers and Excel.</p>
<p> With the 'Edit' button, at the top right, you can add, delete and rearrange the groups of timers.</p>
<p>A tap on the name of a time counter group activates the keyboard to change the name.</p>
<p>With a tap on the '>' button next to each name, you can access the group counter page.</p>
<h3>The second page lists the times of the chosen group..</h3>
<img src="seconda_pagina.png" alt="second page" title="second page" />
<p>Each row is made up of four buttons:</p>
<ol>
<li>name;</li>
<li>'&#8594;' (follow);</li>
<li>time (large numbers);</li>
<li>start / stop (small numbers).</li>
</ol>
<img src="selettori.png" alt="selectors" title="selectors" />
<p>The first row is a header, it always remains visible and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>A tap on the name of a time counter activates the keyboard to change the name.</p>
<p>A touch on the selector '&#8594;' (follow) changes it between active and inactive; when the relative counter is active, it will start on its own when the time above elapses.</p>
<p>The time button indicates the remaining time (the time set when the counter is stopped). If the counter is not stopped, the time continues to move forward and once exceeded zero, the '+' sign is added.</p>
<h3>Time measurement</h3>
<ol>
	<li>deactivate the next follow (if it is not the last counter of the group);</li>
	<li>tap the time button and set the time to zero;</li>
	<li>touch the start / stop button on the side to start the counter;</li>
	<li>at the end touch the time button, in the center, to stop the counter;</li>
	<li>you can further adapt the time using the selection rotators;</li>
	<li>you can set a periodic warning or before the deadline.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Time control</h3>
<ol>
	<li>touch the start / stop button on the side to start the counter;</li>
	<li>if a warning is set, periodically and before the deadline, the vibration and a sound will be activated at the requested time;</li>
	<li>
at the end of the time the vibration and a sound will be activated, different from the warning sound of point 2;
		<ul>
			<li> if there is an underlying counter with the 'follow' selector active, the same stops and the underlying starts;</li>
			<li> otherwise the counter continues, with the '+' sign on the time, until it is stopped manually, using the 'start / stop' button or it reaches 60 '.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3> Accessibility</h3>
<p>The font size follows the settings of the iPhone Settings/General/Accessibility/Larger text, with the iPhone in portrait orientation and the larger characters each counter is described on two lines: the first with name and 'follow', the second with time and 'start/stop'.
